    "# Analysis of the Passenger Demographics of the Titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With [data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv) provided from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), we can investigate information about the 891 of the passengers of the Titanic, from whether they had relatives aboard, to the fare they paid, and ultimately comparing these factors to survivorship to find any interesting relationships.  For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume the availability of the data was random (and that the convenience sampling method of collection has not harmed the usefulness of the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations in the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are presented is not perfect.  As we will see below, some of the data is incomplete.  There are 891 entries in the data, but only 204 instances of fares and 714 instances of age (with some ages being estimated).  Trusting the estimations of the compilers, we still must handle missing values.  This is done first in the setup as data is added to a Pandas DataFrame object from the CSV file: Missing values are given an 'n/a' marker so that they do not interfere with later mathematical and plotting operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also limiting our analysis is how the data is grouped.  It would be optimal if we were given counts for each passenger of the number of parents they had aboard, number of children they had aboard, number of siblings they had aboard, and number of spouses they had aboard.  Grouping parents and children, and spouses and siblings confuses our analysis, because the relationship between a passenger is very different if they had a child aboard versus a parent aboard, and also very different if they had a spouse aboard versus if they had a sibling aboard; especially that spouses and siblings are combined is confusing.  This conflating of relationships makes it impossible to ask questions about whether having a sibling aboard meant better survival, or being a parent meant lower survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions Asked\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis starts by inquiring about passenger relationships, first by analyzing the frequency with which passengers traveled with their parents and children, and their siblings and spouses, and then by analyzing the connection between boarding location and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of the analysis concerns the connection between variables and survival. First, gender and survival are compared using a difference of proportions Z-test.  Next, age and survival are compared using a Chi-squared test, with categories being age groups of 10.  Finally, because age and survivorship were found *not* to be independent, a correlation was found to predict the affect of age on survivorship. \n"

    "\n",
    "We investigated a broad range of questions in a short amount of time.  We found that there was some relationship between the number of parents and children a passenger had aboard, and the number of siblings and spouses they had aboard.  The relationship between these two, and location embarked, however, was not so clear.  We then moved on to the more significant question of how variables affected survival.  We firmly rejected the hypothesis that men and women survived at equal rates (women's survivorship was much greater).  We also found that age was not independent of survivorship, and proceded to find the slope of decreased survivorship from a marginal year of age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis here was not intended to be complete, and opens up further questions to consider with the data provided.  First, because age and gender were found not to be independent of survivorship, more needs to be explored to add conclusivity to the analysis, specificly whether there is a lurking variable that can be found within the data that explain the relationships.  For example, did passengers on higher decks (nearer the lifeboats) tend to be younger and female?  This might explain the difference in survivorship between older and younger, and female vs male better.  To perform this analysis, seeing as how there is a limited availability of cabin information, an analog could be found using fare information.  Fare would presumably predict if a passenger was first, second or third class, which would predict the level on the ship in which the passenger would reside.  The analysis here is a step toward a holistic analysis of the data.\n",
